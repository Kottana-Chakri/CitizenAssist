**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/f11c870c-d994-430f-ae6b-b41e18266bc1

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure API Keys (Optional)

For enhanced AI features, copy the example environment file and add your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your keys:
```bash
# Google Gemini API Key (for AI responses)
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

# ElevenLabs API Key (for text-to-speech)
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key_here
```

**üîí Security Note**: Never commit real API keys to version control. The `.env.local` file is ignored by git.

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## API Key Setup

### Google Gemini API
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env.local` as `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`

### ElevenLabs API
1. Sign up at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io)
2. Go to your profile settings to get your API key
3. Add it to your `.env.local` as `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`

## Usage

1. **Without API Keys**: The app works with mock responses for demonstration
2. **With Gemini Key**: Gets real AI responses from Google's Gemini model
3. **With ElevenLabs Key**: Adds text-to-speech audio for AI responses
4. **User Sign-in**: Click "Sign in" to save your chat history locally

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks + localStorage
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (optional)
- **TTS**: ElevenLabs API (optional)
- **Authentication**: Local-only (no server required)
